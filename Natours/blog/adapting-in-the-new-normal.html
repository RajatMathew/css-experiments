            <p class="blog-text">“Necessity is the mother of invention” — Plato.

                <p class="blog-text">The world is ever-evolving, and these challenging times has further forced us to evolve — to adapt to the changes brought about by the pandemic. The unprecedented coronavirus pandemic has put the world to a standstill and disrupted virtually every industry in the world. Economists often draw parallels between the Great Depression of the 1930s and the ongoing economic nosedive. In the middle of this turmoil, we found new ways to adapt to this massive disruption, and technology is the driving force that makes it possible.</p>
                
                <p class="blog-text">From conducting online meetings to encouraging employees to work from home, businesses and organizations are finding innovative solutions to mitigate the crisis. Let’s take a look into the challenges in the new normal and how the world is adapting to it using technology :</p>
                
                <h3 class="blog-text">Education</h3>
                
                <p class="blog-text">The pandemic has caused the shutdown of schools and colleges worldwide since governments started imposing countermeasures to tackle the spread of the disease, which has affected millions of students worldwide. This caused a shift from the centuries-old teaching methods to ‘learning at home’ in most developed and developing countries as a last resort. There are several challenges associated with online schooling, ranging from web and computer accessibility in rural areas to conducting foolproof exams.</p>
                
                    <p class="blog-text">The digital divide poses huge challenges in providing education in underdeveloped countries. As of 2020, only around 60% of the world’s population has access to the internet. The cost of devices and data plans, low bandwidth, internet outage, and many other factors causes the children in underdeveloped countries to fall short of quality education. In a time where our lives become increasingly dependent on technology, a significant part of the population including the elderly are feeling marginalized, because of their lack of tech literacy. In a world where access to the internet is considered a basic human right, it becomes essential to provide internet access to everyone for free to minimize the digital divide.</p>
                
                Cinema
                
                <p class="blog-text">The cinema industry was hit hard by the pandemic. Theatres became irrelevant. Production of many big-budget movies was halted, and the release of many potential blockbuster hits was postponed indefinitely. Some filmmakers adapted by shifting to OTT (over-the-top) release on platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Video Prime. People relinquished the Big screen experience for enjoying movies in the comfort of their homes.</p>
                
                    <p class="blog-text">In the middle of this havoc, C U Soon was a noteworthy movie, written and directed by Mahesh Narayanan. It was shot during the lockdown period, complying with all the social distancing norms enforced by the government. The movie made a mark by challenging the status quo — rather than using expensive gear and throwing big bucks, the movie focussed on clear storytelling, and doing things differently. Most of the movie’s scenes show a computer screen, where the characters communicate through different instant messaging apps, and the rest of the scenes were shot just on an iPhone!</p>
                
                        <p class="blog-text">OTT release comes with its trade-offs; Big budget movies are unlikely to be profitable with an OTT release, compared to the box office collection if it went for a theater release. Soorarai Pottru is an upcoming big-budget movie produced by actor Suriya, who recently announced that the movie will be released via Amazon Prime. Let’s see how it goes!</p>

                Work from home
                
                <p class="blog-text">Companies have started to realize the potential benefits of allowing employees to work from home. From reduced operational costs to enabling the workforce to work more flexibly and spend less time on commuting, WFH has brought about a lot of benefits to companies as well as the employees. Employees can work more independently and can spend more time with their loved ones. Remote working tools including Zoom, Trello, and many others have become the norm among employees working at home.</p>
                
                    <p class="blog-text">Even after the coronavirus pandemic recedes, working from home is likely to stay in place since companies and employees have started to realize it’s advantages. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and TCS have already stated plans to let a significant part of their employees to work from home.</p>
                
                E-commerce
                
                <p class="blog-text">The retail industry has undergone massive disruption in the post-COVID scenario, mainly because the consumers hesitated to go to retail stores due to the fear of contagion of the virus, and store closures in many places. Consequently, e-commerce transactions skyrocketed worldwide. There was a sudden 66% spike in global daily e-commerce sales, as per a report by Nosto.</p>
                
                    <p class="blog-text">Some studies suggest that e-commerce firms would see massive business growth as people become averse to visit brick and mortar stores for fear of contracting COVID-19.</p>
                
                        <p class="blog-text">A survey conducted by Capgemini says: “59% of consumers worldwide said they had high levels of interaction with physical stores before COVID-19, but today less than a quarter (24%) see themselves in that high-interaction category. In the next 6–9 months, 39% of consumers expect a high level of interaction with physical stores — clearly below the pre-COVID levels”</p>
                
                            <p class="blog-text">The pandemic has put the world in peril; a world full of uncertainties and challenges we’ve never seen before. But through technological innovation, resilience, and proper countermeasures against the virus spread, we are able to mitigate the crisis and adapt to a new world — a world with new hopes and new rules.</p>
